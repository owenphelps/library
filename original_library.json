The number of web developers using P3P continues to grow. P3P support is now built into the newest browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, and Mozilla. \"Web Privacy with P3P\" explains the P3P protocol and shows web site developers how to configure their sites for P3P compliance. Author Lorrie Faith Cranor, chair of the Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P) Specification Working Group at the W3C and co-author of the P3P1.0 specification, explains the inner workings of the P3P protocol while maintaining a hands-on implementation approach. Following a foreword by Stanford Law professor Lawrence Lessig, the book begins with an introduction to P3P and an overview of online privacy concerns and the laws governing online privacy. Cranor discusses existing privacy technology, such as encryption tools, filters and identity management tools. Next, the book shows you how to P3P-enable your own site. Among the many topics covered are: P3P deployment steps P3P policy syntax Creating P3P policies Creating and referencing policy reference files Data schemas Full of examples and case studies, \"Web Privacy withP3P\" delivers practical advice and insider tips. Software developers, privacy consultants, corporate decision-makers, lawyers, public policy-makers, and any individual interested in online privacy issues will find this book a necessary reference.", "ISBN" : "9780596003715", "author" : "Lorrie Faith Cranor", "publisher" : "O'Reilly Media", "publishedDate" : { "$date" : 1032735600000 }, "smallThumbnail" : "http://bks0.books.google.co.uk/books?id=KVEV7c7gghEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail" : "http://bks0.books.google.co.uk/books?id=KVEV7c7gghEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" }

Metadata is increasingly central to enterprise IT architecture, and to applications ranging from data warehousing to CRM. Finally, there's a comprehensive, start-to-finish guide to implementing metadata solutions. Leading data management consultant Adrienne Tannenbaum covers the real issues associated with bringing together data from multiple sources, identifies the key challenges to building effective metadata systems, and presents practical solutions. Tannenbaum begins by focusing on data, its relationship to knowledge, why it is so hard to locate, and how metadata can help. She reviews the key elements of a metadata solution, including metamodels, metadata stores, and repositories, and presents a complete methodology for planning and implementing a metadata solution. She reviews non-technical factors such as readiness and scoping, as well as technical issues such as architecture, exchange, and presentation. Tannenbaum compares today's leading metadata approaches and solutions, including solutions that leave metadata in place, accessing it through a common portal or gateway, as well as solutions that centralize metadata. The book concludes with a thorough discussion of managing metadata solutions and maintaining metadata quality.

Lighter, faster, more powerful than existing data abstraction interfaces, PDO is an open-source query abstraction layer for accessing databases and manipulating returned records that is used with a database-specific PDO driver to access a particular database. It has the same role as classic database abstraction layers such as ODBC and JDBC.

ActionScript is Macromedia's programming language for Flash MX, the popular authoring tool for creating rich internet applications and animations for the Web. With Macromedia's new focus on application development, ActionScript now includes a direct drawing API, loading of external MP3 and JPG files, improved sound control, an extensive set of text formatting tools, complete support for component development using movie clip subclasses, local data storage, accessibility features, and much more. And ActionScript for Flash MX: The Definitive Guide is the most complete, up-to-date reference available for the latest version of this language. Author Colin Moock, one of the most universally respected developers in the Flash community, has added hundreds of new code examples to show new Flash MX techniques in the real world: how to draw circles, save data to disk, convert arrays to onscreen tables, create reusable components, and preload variables, XML, and sounds. The book's language reference alone has nearly doubled from the first edition, with more than 250 new classes, objects, methods, and properties. You'll find exhaustive coverage of dozens of undocumented, under-documented, and mis-documented features. Along with the new material, Colin Moock has meticulously revised the entire text to conform to Flash MX best-coding practices. In particular, objected-oriented programming and the new event model get special attention in light of changes to Flash MX ActionScript. From sending data between two movies to creating getter/setter properties, the new edition of this book demystifies the often-confusing new features of Flash MX, giving developers easy access to its powerful new capabilities. ActionScript for Flash MX: The Definitive Guide is structured so non-programmers can learn how to use ActionScript and programmers can take their skills to new heights. If you are in the market to really learn about the hows and whys of ActionScript, then this is the book for you.", "ISBN" : "9780596003968", "author" : "Colin Moock", "publisher" : "O'Reilly Media", "publishedDate" : { "$date" : 1332788580000 }, "smallThumbnail" : "http://bks1.books.google.co.uk/books?id=k2go4AjBUbUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail" : "http://bks1.books.google.co.uk/books?id=k2go4AjBUbUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" }

Flash 5 is the latest version of Macromedia's incredibly successful motion graphics creation package. Flash 5 implements a vastly expanded and more powerful range of ActionScript components. It is ActionScript, coupled with Flash's exceptional graphical facilities, that makes Flash the de facto standard for interactive, graphically-rich web sites and applications. The new implementation will make ActionScript an even more important part of the Flash landscape. Who is this Book for? Flash 5 beginners who've read an introductory text and need a much more in-depth introduction to ActionScript. Flash 4 users who need a fuller understanding of ActionScript as implemented in Flash 5. What does the Book cover? Flash 5 ActionScript provides a raft of new features for the Flash designer to use. To fully exploit these features, the designer will need to understand a basic set of programming constructs and principles. This book will teach those principles in the Flash 5 context, providing the reader with a solid base to develop more complex ActionScript skills. The book has a strong tutorial thrust, focusing on building the core skills that the reader needs to master Flash ActionScript. The skills and techniques are built in self-contained chapters that combine in an ongoing case study to build a rich knowledge base in the reader's mind. Summary of Contents Part 1: ActionScript Basics 1. Basics 2. The interface 3. Planning 4. Timeline actions 5. Variables and notation 6. Looping and Decision Making 7. Sound 8. Basic Interactivity. 9. Advanced interactivity 10. Debugging Part 2: Moving Forward with ActionScript 11. Structured actionScript. 12. Sprite animation (advanced animation). 13. Intro to advanced ActionScripting Reviews www.pixelsurgeon.com 9 out of 10 Review by Jason Arbernaut \"The success of Foundation ActionScript is down to Sham Bhangal's extremely clear writing style and following the creation, in the book, of an actual website from initial designs to complex actionscripting. Bhangal eases us into the world of ActionScript using charming analogies which are always on the mark and never patronising or condescending. Commands, Arguments and Properties are explained in real world terms, and to be honest, is the first time that ActionScript as been made completely transparent and obvious to me. Having grounded us in a clear understanding of the fundamentals of ActionScript, Bhangal proceeds to build his website, explaining as he goes along. Flash 5 ActionScript has a steep learning curve, particularly for those migrating from earlier versions of Flash and have the Flash 4 way of doing things flowing through their veins. Bhangal takes the time to explain the differences between the two scripting languages, and why Flash 5 ActionScript is better. You'll never learn anything by simply reading about it. You need to roll your sleeves up and follow the exercises and examples. There is no CD provided with the book, but all the .fla files can be found at the Friends of Ed website for download and dissection. The examples in the book are easy to follow and the rationale behind each line of code is explained. Over the course of the book Bhangal begins to speed up and starts dealing with fairly complex scripts. But thanks to his humour, clear prose and relevant examples, the complexity never feels overwhelming. Each task is achievable and rewarding in the insight that it gives to ActionScript. Having tackled sound, advanced interactivity, modular code and sprites, Bhangal finishes up with a useful glossary and sections on events, properties, operators, Flash 5 compatability and debugging. You'll be amazed at the Flash you'll be producing after reading this book. Even seasoned Flash power-users will be sure to pick up tips and tricks. If an idiot like me can read this book, be illuminated and see an immediate improvement in my Flash ActionScript skills then pretty much everyone will benefit. I can't recommend this book highly enough!

All are examples of classification—the scaffolding of information infrastructures. In Sorting Things Out, Geoffrey Bowker and Susan Leigh Star explore the role of categories and standards in shaping the modern world. In a clear and lively style, they investigate a variety of classification systems, including the International Classification of Diseases, the Nursing Interventions Classification, race classification under apartheid in South Africa, and the classification of viruses and of tuberculosis. Sorting Things Out has a moral agenda, for each standard and category valorizes some point of view and silences another. Standards and classifications produce advantage or suffering. Jobs are made and lost; some regions benefit at the expense of others. How these choices are made and how we think about that process are at the moral and political core of this work. The book is an important empirical source for understanding the building of information infrastructures.", "ISBN" : "9780262522953", "author" : "Geoffrey C.

The Windows Workflow Foundation supports development of both sequential and state-based workflow involving both human and system interaction. Sequential workflow is a map of activities that may be in series or parallel. State-based workflow is a state machine where events cause transitions. Rules can be specified that drive decision making in a workflow and can be updated easily at runtime. Workflow can be created as a model and executed inside many host applications including Windows Forms, console applications, or Web applications. Key Scenarios that can be developed with Windows Workflow Foundation include: Document management: The steps involved in the review and approval of shared documents or other content. Line of business application: The processing flow or business logic in an extensible part of the application. Website page flow: The flow of state variables between web pages. IT management: Handling of common systems management processes. Decision making logic: Where complex business logic is well described by a sequential or state diagram.

They introduce the beginnings of science to a domain which had, up till now, been ruled by craft.\" Tom DeMarcoIt is widely recognized that incorrect requirements account for up to 60% of errors in software products, and yet the majority of software development organizations do not have a formal requirements process. Many organizations appear willing to spend huge amounts on fixing and altering badly-specified software, but seem unwilling to invest a much smaller amount to get the requirements right in the first place. This is a book for those who want to get the right requirements. Mastering the Requirements Process sets out an industry-tested process for gathering and verifying requirements. It provides the techniques and insights for discovering precisely what the customer wants and needs. \"Mastering the Requirements Process shows, step by step, template by template, example by example, one well-tested way to assemble a complete, comprehensive requirements process.\" Gerald WeinbergThe specification template in this book provides the basis for your own requirements specifications. It guides you to the correct specification content as each part of the process reveals different aspects of the products functionality and properties. This book shows you how to make the requirement measurable and testable. By providing a measurement a fit criterion for each requirement, the requirements analyst can describe precisely what the customerwants, the designer can construct a product that exactly matches the requirement, and the tester can determine whether or not the final solution satisfies the requirement.\"The Robertsons\" concept of fit criteria is all by itself worth the investment of your time to read the whole book. Fit criteria and the allied discipline of quality gateways enable you to build requirement sets that are measurable, provably correct and testibly complete.\" Tom DeMarcoFeatures:7 The Volere requirements process completely specified with a rigorous and detailed model. 7 A specification template that can be used as the basis for your own requirements specifications. 7 The requirements shell used for bringing rigor, tracability and completeness to requirements. 7 Checklists to help identify stakeholders, users, non-functional requirements and more. 7 Trawling techniques for eliciting requirements. 7 How to exploit use cases to determine the best product to build. 7 Reusing requirements and requirements patterns. 7 Examples showing how the techniques and templates are applied in real-world situations. 7 Accessible style, fully cross-referenced, numerous diagrams.The Authors: Suzanne Robertson is a leading figure in the world of systems analysis and requirements modeling. She is the roving ambassador for the British Computer Society\"s Reuse Group and is on organizing committees for the International Conference on Software Reuse and Object Technology. James Robertson brings the experience of working and consulting on requirements with several hundred companies to this book. When his busy seminar schedule permits, James advises companies on how to adapt to a world where requirements are paramount. Suzanne andJames are principals of the Atlantic Systems Guild, an international think-tank producing numerous books and seminars that are among the most successful in the software industry.Visit Addison Wesley Longman on the World Wide Web at: http: //www.awl-he.com/computing/http: //www.com/cseng/BarcodeBack of Jacket", "ISBN" : "9780201360462", "author" : "Suzanne Robertson, James Robertson", "publisher" : "Addison-Wesley Professional", "publishedDate" : { "$date" : 922457284000 }, "smallThumbnail" : "http://bks7.books.google.co.uk/books?id=ivhGAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail" : "http://bks7.books.google.co.uk/books?id=ivhGAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api" }

Even the most experienced system administrators have found it challenging to configure and difficult to understand. For help in unraveling its intricacies, sendmail administrators have turned unanimously to one reliable source--the bat book, or \"sendmail\" by Bryan Costales and the creator of sendmail, Eric Allman. Now in its third edition, this best-selling reference will help you master the most demanding version of sendmail yet. The new edition of sendmail has been completely revised to cover sendmail 8.12--a version with more features and fundamental changes than any previous version of the Unix-based email routing program. Because the latest version of sendmail differs so significantly from earlier versions, a massive rewrite of this best-selling reference was called for. The book begins by guiding you through the building and installation of sendmail and its companion programs, such as vacation and makemap. These additional programs are pivotal to sendmail's daily operation. Next, you'll cover the day-to-day administration of sendmail. This section includes two entirely new chapters, \"Performance Tuning\" to help you make mail delivery as efficient as possible, and \"Handling Spam\" to deal with sendmail's rich anti-spam features. The next section of the book tackles the sendmail configuration file and debugging. And finally, the book wraps up with five appendices that provide more detail about sendmail than you may ever need. Altogether, versions 8.10 through 8.12 include dozens of newfeatures, options, and macros, and this greatly expanded edition thoroughly addresses each, and provides and advance look at sendmail version 8.13 (expected to be released in 2003). With \"sendmail,\" Third Edition in hand, you will be able to configure this challenging but necessary utility for whatever needs your system requires.

This compelling and research-based book will not only identify the emerging components of this shift, but will also help companies build their businesses around it, regardless of what specific new technologies come along.The word on social computing has been out for a while. It's game changing. Books like Wikinomics begin to describe what the networked world has become. But institutions of all kinds need more than descriptive context. They need tools to navigate the shift in power that social computing and web communities have created. They need data on how their customers use and perceive new media, and guidance about what it means to their business. More than that, they need sophisticated advice that tells them how to turn this new reality to their advantage. This book provides that data and advice.Li and Bernoff, well-known thought leaders in the area of social technology, have used their considerable resources at Forrester Research to generate hard consumer data that quantifies a viable business opportunity. Based on their work with dozens of companies presented in the book, the authors are able to credibly describe how business can participate in the new social medium in order to communicate with, energize, support, and learn from their customers. More importantly, their work offers proof that prepared organizations can reap significant financial benefits in product development, marketing, PR, sales, and customer retention.

Russ Olsen has done a great job of selecting classic patterns and augmenting these with newer patterns that have special relevance for Ruby. He clearly explains each idea, making a wealth of experience available to Ruby developers for their own daily work.\" -Steve Metsker, Managing Consultant with Dominion Digital, Inc. \"This book provides a great demonstration of the key 'Gang of Four'design patterns without resorting to overly technical explanations. Written in a precise, yet almost informal style, this book covers enough ground that even those without prior exposure to design patterns will soon feel confident applying them using Ruby. Olsen has done a great job to make a book about a classically 'dry'subject into such an engaging and even occasionally humorous read.\" -Peter Cooper \"This book renewed my interest in understanding patterns after a decade of good intentions. Russ picked the most useful patterns for Ruby and introduced them in a straightforward and logical manner, going beyond the GoF's patterns. This book has improved my use of Ruby, and encouraged me to blow off the dust covering the GoF book.\" -Mike Stok \" Design Patterns in Rubyis a great way for programmers from statically typed objectoriented languages to learn how design patterns appear in a more dynamic, flexible language like Ruby.\" -Rob Sanheim, Ruby Ninja, Relevance Most design pattern books are based on C++ and Java. But Ruby is different-and the language's unique qualities make design patterns easier to implement and use. In this book, Russ Olsen demonstrates how to combine Ruby's power and elegance with patterns, and write more sophisticated, effective software with far fewer lines of code. After reviewing the history, concepts, and goals of design patterns, Olsen offers a quick tour of the Ruby language-enough to allow any experienced software developer to immediately utilize patterns with Ruby. The book especially calls attention to Ruby features that simplify the use of patterns, including dynamic typing, code closures, and \"mixins\" for easier code reuse. Fourteen of the classic \"Gang of Four\" patterns are considered from the Ruby point of view, explaining what problems each pattern solves, discussing whether traditional implementations make sense in the Ruby environment, and introducing Ruby-specific improvements. You'll discover opportunities to implement patterns in just one or two lines of code, instead of the endlessly repeated boilerplate that conventional languages often require. Design Patterns in Rubyalso identifies innovative new patterns that have emerged from the Ruby community. These include ways to create custom objects with metaprogramming, as well as the ambitious Rails-based \"Convention Over Configuration\" pattern, designed to help integrate entire applications and frameworks.

In those situations, this book will be invaluable. If you're looking for an inside guide to putting together the working framework of a flexible, robust content management system in PHP 5, this book is for you. As a former development team leader on the renowned Mambo open-source content management system, author Martin Brampton offers unique insight and practical guidance into the problem of building an architecture for a content management system. Following the scene-setting first chapter, each chapter in the book tackles a different aspect of developing the author's new Aliro PHP 5 CMS framework, with: .A concise statement of the problem .Discussion of the important design issues and problems faced .Creation of the framework solution The framework is built on a strongly object-oriented architecture throughout, including adherence to MVC principles, and you will learn how to create classes for handling such things as menus, modules, components, sessions, and user tracking. Administration and security issues are discussed as an integral part of the design and implementation of framework features. The final chapter discusses the key issues that affect a wide range of specific content handlers and explores a practical example in detail. You will learn about: .The general characteristics of systems to create websites .Effective coding and object architectures to fully exploit PHP 5 .A foundation for database processing to ease further development .Technical functions such as handling sessions, caches, errors, XML, mail, and files.Management of website users .Flexible, practical deployment of role based access control .Internationalization .Handling extensibility beyond the basic framework .General concepts of menus without prior commitments to detail .Delivery and presentation of different kinds of user-oriented content Approach The book includes extensive discussion of the design issues, and how to overcome them in the framework. Each chapter of the book focuses on a particular requirement of the framework. The book will not present the total code for the framework, showing only the parts that raise critical design or implementation issues. For these, detailed explanation is given, leaving the less problematic parts to the code download itself", "ISBN" : "9781847193575", "author" : "Martin Brampton", "publisher" : "Packt Pub Ltd", "publishedDate" : { "$date" : 1332788880000 }, "smallThumbnail" : "http://bks9.books.google.co.uk/books?id=nXoZAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail" : "http://bks9.books.google.co.uk/books?id=nXoZAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api" }

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "4f7073c6a0187978e3000080" }, "title" : "Professional Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Administration", "description" : "SQL Server 2008 represents a sizable jump forward in scalability, performance, and usability for the DBA, developer, and business intelligence (BI) developer. It is no longer unheard of to have 20-terabyte databases running on a SQL Server. SQL Server administration used to just be the job of a database administrator (DBA), but as SQL Server proliferates throughout smaller companies, many developers have begun to act as administrators as well. Additionally, some of the new features in SQL Server are more developer-centric, and poor configuration of these features can result in poor performance. SQL Server now enables you to manage the policies on hundreds of SQL Servers in your environment as if you were managing a single instance. We've provided a comprehensive, tutorial-based book to get you over the learning curve of how to configure and administer SQL Server 2008. Whether you're an administrator or developer using SQL Server, you can't avoid wearing a DBA hat at some point. Developers often have SQL Server on their own workstations and must provide guidance to the administrator about how they'd like the production configured. Oftentimes, they're responsible for creating the database tables and indexes. Administrators or DBAs support the production servers and often inherit the database from the developer. This book is intended for developers, DBAs, and casual users who hope to administer or may already be administering a SQL Server 2008 system and its business intelligence features, such as Integration Services. This book is a \"professional \"book, meaning the authors assume that you know the basics about how to query a SQL Server and have some rudimentary concepts of SQL Server already. For example, this book does not show you how to create a database or walk you through the installation of SQL Server using the wizard. Instead, the author of the installation chapter may provide insight into how to use some of the more advanced concepts of the installation. Although this book does not cover how to query a SQL Server database, it does cover how to tune the queries you've already written. The first ten chapters of the book are about administering the various areas of SQL Server, including the developer and business intelligence features. Chapter 1 briefly covers the architecture of SQL Server and the changing role of the DBA. Chapters 2 and 3 dive into best practices on installing and upgrading to SQL Server 2008. Managing your SQL Server database instance is talked about in Chapter 4. This chapter also describes some of the hidden tools you may not even know you have. Once you know how to manage your SQL Server, you can learn in Chapter 5 how to automate many of the redundant monitoring and maintenance tasks. This chapter also discusses best practices on configuring SQL Server Agent. Chapters 6 and 7 cover how to properly administer and automate many tasks inside of the Microsoft business intelligence products, such as Integration Services and Analysis Services. Developers will find that Chapter 8 is very useful, as it covers how to administer the development features, such as SQL CLR. Chapter 9 explains how to secure your SQL Server from many common threats and how to create logins and users. Chapter 10 covers how to create a SQL Server project and do proper change management in promoting your scripts through the various environments. It also covers the Policy-Based Management framework in SQL Server. Chapters 11 through 15 make up the performance tuning part of the book. Chapter 11 discusses how to choose the right hardware configuration for your SQL Server in order to achieve optimal performance. After the hardware and operating system is configured, Chapter 12 shows you how to optimize your SQL Server instance for the best performance. Chapter 13 describes how to monitor your SQL Server instance for problematic issues such as blocking and locking. Chapters 14 and 15 discuss how to optimize the T-SQL that accesses your tables and then how to index your tables appropriately. Chapters 16 through 20 consist of the high-availability chapters of the book. Chapter 16 covers how to use the various forms of replication, while database mirroring is covered in Chapter 17. Classic issues and best practices with backing up and recovering your database are discussed in Chapter 18. Chapter 19 dives deeply into the role of log shipping in your high-availability strategy, and Chapter 20 presents a step-by-step guide to clustering your SQL Server and Windows 2008 server. This edition of the book covers all the same great information we covered in the last book, and we've added loads of new content for SQL Server 2008, which adds numerous new features to improve the DBA's life. In short, the new version of SQL Server focuses on improving your efficiency, the scale of your server, and the performance of your environment, so you can do more in much less time, and with fewer resources and people. This means you can manage many servers at one time using Policy-Based Management, scale your I/O load using compression, and collect valuable information about your environment using data collectors, to name just a few key new features. To follow the examples in this book, you will need to have SQL Server 2008 installed. If you wish to learn how to administer the business intelligence features, you need to have Analysis Services and the Integration Services components installed. You need a machine that can support the minimum hardware requirements to run SQL Server 2008; and you also need the AdventureWorks2008 and AdventureWorksDW2008 databases installed. Instructions for accessing these databases can be found in the ReadMe file on this book's Web site. Some features in this book (especially in the high-availability part) require the Enterprise or Developer Edition of SQL Server. If you do not have this edition, you will still be able to follow through some of the examples in the chapter with Standard Edition.", "ISBN" : "9780470247969", "author" : "Brian Knight, Ketan Patel, Wayne Snyder, Ross LoForte, Steven Wort", "publisher" : "Wrox", "publishedDate" : { "$date" : 1224198000000 }, "smallThumbnail" : "http://bks5.books.google.co.uk/books?id=hWS7NQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail" : "http://bks5.books.google.co.uk/books?id=hWS7NQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api" }

Well, the most efficient way to detect your mistakes in PHP is with PHPUnit, an open source framework that automates unit testing by running a battery of tests as you go. The benefits of PHPUnit are significant: a reduction in the effort required to frequently test code fewer overall defects added confidence in your code improved relations with your open source teammates The only problem with this popular testing tool was its lack of documentation-until now, that is. For this, O'Reilly went right to the source, as Sebastian Bergmann, the author of \"PHPUnit Pocket Guide,\" also happens to be PHPUnit's creator. This little book brings together hard-to-remember information, syntax, and rules for working with PHPUnit. It also delivers the insight and sage advice that can only come from the technology's creator. Coverage of testing under agile methodologies and Extreme Programming (XP) is also included. The latest in O'Reilly's series of handy \"Pocket Guides,\" this quick-reference book puts all the answers are right at your fingertips.

Anyone who feels that TDD is “Too Damn Difficult” will appreciate this book. Design Driven Testingshows that, by combining a forward-thinking development process with cutting-edge automation, testing can be a finely targeted, business-driven, rewarding effort. In other words, you'll learn how to test smarter, not harder. Applies a feedback-driven approach to each stage of the project lifecycle. Illustrates a lightweight and effective approach using a core subset of UML. Follows a real-life example project using Java and Flex/ActionScript. Presents bonus chapters for advanced DDTers covering unit-test antipatterns (and their opposite, “test-conscious” design patterns), and showing how to create your own test transformation templates in Enterprise Architect. What you'll learn Create unit and behavioral tests using JUnit, NUnit, FlexUnit. Generate acceptance tests for all usage paths through use case thread expansion. Generate requirement tests for functional requirements. Run complex acceptance tests across the enterprise. Isolate individual control points for self-contained unit/behavioral tests. Apply Behavior Driven Development frameworks like JBehave and NBehave Who this book is for Design Driven Testingshould appeal to developers, project managers, testers, business analysts, architects...in fact anyone who builds software that needs to be tested. While equally applicable on both large and small projects,Design Driven Testingis especially helpful to those developers who need to verify their software against formal requirements. Such developers will benefit greatly from the rational and disciplined approach espoused by the authors.

Beck introduces a new way of thinking about programming by basing his discussion on values and principles.\" Diomidis Spinellis, author ofCode ReadingandCode Quality Software Expert Kent Beck Presents a Catalog of Patterns Infinitely Useful for Everyday Programming Great code doesn't just function: it clearly and consistently communicates your intentions, allowing other programmers to understand your code, rely on it, and modify it with confidence. But great code doesn't just happen. It is the outcome of hundreds of small but critical decisions programmers make every single day. Now, legendary software innovator Kent Beckknown worldwide for creating Extreme Programming and pioneering software patterns and test-driven developmentfocuses on these critical decisions, unearthing powerful \"implementation patterns\" for writing programs that are simpler, clearer, better organized, and more cost effective. Beck collects 77 patterns for handling everyday programming tasks and writing more readable code. This new collection of patterns addresses many aspects of development, including class, state, behavior, method, collections, frameworks, and more. He uses diagrams, stories, examples, and essays to engage the reader as he illuminates the patterns.

Getting software released to users is often a painful, risky, and time-consuming process. This groundbreaking new book sets out the principles and technical practices that enable rapid, incremental delivery of high quality, valuable new functionality to users. Through automation of the build, deployment, and testing process, and improved collaboration between developers, testers, and operations, delivery teams can get changes released in a matter of hours- sometimes even minutes–no matter what the size of a project or the complexity of its code base. Jez Humble and David Farley begin by presenting the foundations of a rapid, reliable, low-risk delivery process. Next, they introduce the “deployment pipeline,” an automated process for managing all changes, from check-in to release. Finally, they discuss the “ecosystem” needed to support continuous delivery, from infrastructure, data and configuration management to governance. The authors introduce state-of-the-art techniques, including automated infrastructure management and data migration, and the use of virtualization. For each, they review key issues, identify best practices, and demonstrate how to mitigate risks. Coverage includes \" Automating all facets of building, integrating, testing, and deploying software \" Implementing deployment pipelines at team and organizational levels \" Improving collaboration between developers, testers, and operations \" Developing features incrementally on large and distributed teams \" Implementing an effective configuration management strategy \" Automating acceptance testing, from analysis to implementation \" Testing capacity and other non-functional requirements \" Implementing continuous deployment and zero-downtime releases \" Managing infrastructure, data, components and dependencies \" Navigating risk management, compliance, and auditing Whether you're a developer, systems administrator, tester, or manager, this book will help your organization move from idea to release faster than ever-so you can deliver value to your business rapidly and reliably.", "ISBN" : "9780321601919", "author" : "Jez Humble, David Farley", "publisher" : "Addison-Wesley Professional", "publishedDate" : { "$date" : 1280185200000 }, "smallThumbnail" : "http://bks9.books.google.co.uk/books?id=6ADDuzere-YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail" : "http://bks9.books.google.co.uk/books?id=6ADDuzere-YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" }
